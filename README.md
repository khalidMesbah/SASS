##  notes
- CSS variables are called custom properties
- CSS custom properties can be put in `html`, `:root`, and `body` selectors for global use
- you can manipulate css custom properties by javascript and you cannot do that with sass variables
- BEM : B => block, E => element, and M => modifier 
- BEM helps to make class names unique, and if you change the name of the block you don't have to change the name of all the selectors related to it 
- rows and columns are also called tracks
- use `border:solid` or `padding:1px` to kill margin collapse # refer to _grid.scss
- Sass maps are built-in sass module
- Sass maps similar to objects   and dictionaries
